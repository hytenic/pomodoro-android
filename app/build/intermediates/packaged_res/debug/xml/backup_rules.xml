   In this file you can specify which files/directories should be backed up.
   By default, all shared preferences, files in the cache directory, and files in the
   no_backup directory are excluded from backups.

   To learn more about what is and is not backed up, please see the
   associated Android documentation about “Auto Backup for Apps” at
   https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup

   To see a list of currently supported devices, you can run the following command:
       adb shell dumpsys backup

   To specify which files/directories to back up, you can use the <include> and
   <exclude> tags.  By default, all files are included except for those in the
   no_backup directory.  The <include> and <exclude> tags support the following
   attributes:

       - domain:
         Specifies the domain of the file.  Valid values are:
           - file:           Files in the directory returned by getFilesDir().
           - database:       Files in the directory returned by getDatabasePath().
           - sharedpref:     Files in the directory returned by getSharedPreferencesPath().
           - external:       Files in the directory returned by getExternalFilesDir().
           - root:           Files in the path specified by the path attribute.

       - path:
         Specifies the path to the file or directory, relative to the domain.


   Examples:

       To back up all shared preferences:
       <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>

       To back up a specific shared preference file:
       <include domain="sharedpref" path="my_preference_file.xml"/>

       To exclude a specific file from backups:
       <exclude domain="file" path="my_private_file.txt"/>


   The <full-backup-content> section can also contain a <device-specific-content>
   section.  This section can be used to specify different backup rules for
   different devices.

   For example, you can use this to exclude a large file from being backed up
   on low-storage devices.

   <device-specific-content>
       <when minSdk="23" />
       <exclude domain="file" path="large_file.bin"/>
   </device-specific-content>

   -->
</full-backup-content>
